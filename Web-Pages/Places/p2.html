    <pre>Shaniwar Wada, a famous tourist place located in the heart of Pune city, was the headquarters of the Peshwas. It was built in 1736 by Bajirao Peshwa, as a residence for the Peshwas.
         Shaniwar Wada is a stately mansion with intricate carvings and exquisite designs by Maratha artisans. Shaniwar Wada has a 21-ft-tall main door, facing the north. 
         The famous, Dilli Darwaza, or Delhi Gate, is one of the gates of the fort. Another prominent gate is the Mastani Darwaza, believed to have been exclusively used by Bajiraoâ€™s second wife, 
         Mastani. A lotus-shaped fountain is an attractive feature of this Wada. In 1827, a fire broke out, burning down the entire palace, except the Mirror Hall. 
         The remnants include a fortification wall with five gates and nine bastions, enclosing the entire complex, platforms and foundations. 
         A light and music show is conducted inside the Shaniwar Wada fort that brings alive the bygone era of the Peshwas.</pre>
