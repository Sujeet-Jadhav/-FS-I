    <pre>Sinhagad means Lionâ€™s Fort. One of the most famous places to visit, Sinhagad is situated on a hill among the Sahyadri Mountains. 
        Parts of this magnificent fort are in ruins but the fort still attracts trekking enthusiasts. Also famous as the Kondana Fort, it has witnessed several battles, 
        including the 1670 Battle of Sinhagad. About 25 kms from Pune, on a clear day, the forts of Torna, Rajgad and Purandar are visible from Sinhagad Fort. 
        The fortress includes a display of several monoliths of the most efficient safe-keepers, such as Tanaji Malusare of the Shivaji Maharaj era. 
        Near the Sinhagad Fort, trekkers also go bird-watching at the stream. Crested treeswifts, serpent eagle, sunbirds and several other species of birds, can be spotted here.</pre>
