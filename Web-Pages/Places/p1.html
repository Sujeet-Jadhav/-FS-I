    <pre>The Aga Khan Palace was constructed in 1892 under the patronage of Sultan Mohammed Shah, Aga Khan III, on 19 acres of land in the Yerwada area of Pune. 
        The palace, with its stunning architecture, is one of the most famous places to visit in Pune. It is an important landmark in Indian history, instrumental in Indiaâ€™s independence. 
        The palace, also known as the Gandhi National Museum, functioned as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi, his secretary Mahadev Desai and Sarojini Naidu. 
        In 1969, prince Karim al-Husseini, Aga Khan IV, donated the palace to the Indian government, in memory of Mahatma Gandhi and his philosophy.</pre>
